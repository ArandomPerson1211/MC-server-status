I'm working on a simple Minecraft Server Status (MCSS) Python project that supports both Java and Bedrock servers. 


To get started, you will need to install the necessary dependencies this can be easily done using pip.

For example:
```zsh

pip install -r requirement.txt

```

Feel free to let me know if there are any issues.
