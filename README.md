I'm working on a simple Minecraft Server Status (MCSS) Python project that supports both Java and Bedrock servers.
I am not that good a python yet but hoping to learn it fully.

To get started, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. This can be easily done using pip.

For example:
```zsh

pip install -r requirement.txt

```
Feel free to let me know if you encounter any issues.

Note: Java servers will have more functionality than Bedrock it isn't me being lazy it's just Bedrock has less functionality.
