First of all Thanks to [Kai Jane](https://github.com/Kai-Denzel-Jane) For helping me to cleanup and add some code.

This python script is a simple Minecraft Server Status (MCSS) that supports both Java and Bedrock servers.

To get started, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. This can be easily done using pip.

For example:
```zsh

pip install -r requirement.txt

```
Feel free to let me know if you encounter any issues.

Note: Java servers will have more functionality than Bedrock it isn't me being lazy it's just Bedrock has less functionality.
